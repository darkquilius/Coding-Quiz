# Coding-Quiz

The challenge this week was to create a code that dynamically updates using javascript.

Yet to Come:
- Highscore using local storage -
- Implementation of the "glow" class to show the highscore -
- A Timer rather than a wrong answer count -
- More questions added to the test -
- Randomize questions rather than them coming from a standard for loop -
